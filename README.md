# Gum Figma Plugin

A visual Figma plugin and local C#/.NET 10 bridge for turning Figma designs into native Gum UI. External coding agents use MCP or a CLI to request deterministic conversion and connect the generated UI to application behavior.

**Status: specification only.** The approved implementation contract is checked in; the plugin, bridge, and sample application have not been implemented or tested yet. Commands and directory layouts described in the specification are requirements to implement, not currently available features.

## Start here

Read the [approved implementation specification, v0.2](docs/figma-gum-plugin-spec.md).

- **Section 5:** module responsibilities and dependency boundaries.
- **Section 13:** red -> green -> refactor, test layers, and acceptance cases A01-A20.
- **Section 14:** ordered implementation tasks T01-T29.
- **Section 16.2:** copyable implementation-agent handoff prompt.

Repository guidance for coding agents is in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). The specification is authoritative; this README is only an entry point.

## Architecture

The **TypeScript Figma plugin** handles selection, control/state mappings, explicit snapshot publication, diagnostics, and previews. The **local .NET 10 bridge** owns deterministic conversion, Gum tooling, snapshot storage, and guarded file updates through separate modules. Thin CLI and MCP adapters forward to one bridge host; they do not duplicate conversion or file-writing logic.

Figma is the source of record for managed visuals. Native Gum files and generated C# reproduce those visuals. Handwritten application code owns behavior and must survive regeneration.

## Implementation milestones

| Through task | Outcome |
|---|---|
| T10 | Selected Figma frame -> native Gum -> preview. |
| T19 | Standalone sample design and initial control coverage. |
| T23 | Regeneration preserves a handwritten handler that fires exactly once. |
| T29 | Packaged standalone v1 with documented compatibility and acceptance results. |

The implementation supplies its own sample-design creator and Gum test application. No existing game, production Figma design, hosted backend, or specific agent vendor is a prerequisite. Real Figma-client and macOS/Windows compatibility checks remain required before claiming those environments are supported.
