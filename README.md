# Gum Figma Plugin

A visual Figma plugin and local C#/.NET 10 bridge for turning Figma designs into native Gum UI. External coding agents use MCP or a CLI to request deterministic conversion and connect the generated UI to application behavior.

**Status: T01 skeleton only.** The approved contract and initial project/package scaffolding are checked in. The plugin has no runnable UI, the bridge has no executable host or conversion behavior, and the sample application has not been built. Gum toolchain and Figma runtime compatibility have not been verified.

## Start here

Read the [approved implementation specification, v0.2](docs/figma-gum-plugin-spec.md).

- **Section 5:** module responsibilities and dependency boundaries.
- **Section 13:** red -> green -> refactor, test layers, and acceptance cases A01-A20.
- **Section 14:** ordered implementation tasks T01-T29.
- **Section 16.2:** copyable implementation-agent handoff prompt.

Repository guidance for coding agents is in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). The specification is authoritative; this README is only an entry point.

## T01 checks

Install the .NET SDK pinned in `global.json` (10.0.100), Node.js and npm, and Python 3. Run from the repository root:

```sh
dotnet build GumBridge.sln
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/architecture -v
npm ci --prefix apps/figma-plugin
npm run typecheck --prefix apps/figma-plugin
```

`dotnet test GumBridge.sln` currently discovers **no .NET test projects**; the executable architecture gate is the Python unittest command above. The pinned TypeScript and official Figma typings are only compilation dependencies, not evidence of a real Figma client test. SDK pins do not establish Gum tooling or native rendering compatibility; those checks start in the next ticket.

## Architecture

The **TypeScript Figma plugin** handles selection, control/state mappings, explicit snapshot publication, diagnostics, and previews. The **local .NET 10 bridge** owns deterministic conversion, Gum tooling, snapshot storage, and guarded file updates through separate modules. Thin CLI and MCP adapters forward to one bridge host; they do not duplicate conversion or file-writing logic.

Figma is the source of record for managed visuals. Native Gum files and generated C# reproduce those visuals. Handwritten application code owns behavior and must survive regeneration.

## Implementation milestones

| Through task | Outcome |
|---|---|
| T10 | Selected Figma frame -> native Gum -> preview. |
| T19 | Standalone sample design and initial control coverage. |
| T23 | Regeneration preserves a handwritten handler that fires exactly once. |
| T29 | Packaged standalone v1 with documented compatibility and acceptance results. |

The implementation supplies its own sample-design creator and Gum test application. No existing game, production Figma design, hosted backend, or specific agent vendor is a prerequisite. Real Figma-client and macOS/Windows compatibility checks remain required before claiming those environments are supported.
